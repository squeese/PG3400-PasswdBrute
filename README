
  Commands to build are
  make
  make build

  It will compile an executable name 'client', which can then be used to run commands such as:
  
  ./client -t 12 "\$1\$9779ofJE\$c.p.EwsI57yV2xjeorQbs1" -l 2 -I a-z -I A-Z
  ./client "\$1\$7tBjugEa\$h3cZLWYTXCwqikbFvQe7A/" -d misc/dictionary.txt
  ./client "\$1\$K4BfHkEl\$A1mF1S2ztQ7reX7GzWj7v0" -l 3 -I a-z -I A-Z
  ./client "\$1\$RvQQ2SJN\$Q80Nh4Ello9cx9Wllf5Nx/" -d misc/dictionary.txt
  ./client "\$1\$CPqVGNrg\$YH26ye4.Cft6c9AWf0zUn1" -d misc/dictionary.txt
  ./client "\$1\$jgE1qlB8\$l8.Oicr89Ib8DPhV/8nZp1" -d misc/rockyou.txt
  ./client "\$1\$ckvWM6T@\$H6H/R5d4a/QjpB02Ri/V01" -d misc/rockyou.txt

  The commandline options are:
    -d <path to file>       specify a text file with words to search for passwords
    -l <n>                  when generating words, the length of word
    -L <n-m>                same, but with a range
    etc..

  Running without any arguments will give a help menu.
  There is also a shell script hashesh.sh to run those hashes I managed to find password for.
  Other than that, this was a complete disaster.. =)
